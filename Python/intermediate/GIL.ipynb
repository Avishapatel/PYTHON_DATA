    "# The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python is a mutex, or a lock, that allows only one\n",
    "# thread to hold control of the Python interpreter at any given time. \n",

    "# within a single process. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: The primary reason for the GIL's existence is to simplify memory management and ensure thread \n",

    "# and the GIL helps prevent race conditions and deadlocks when managing shared memory.\n",

    "# references that are made internally in python to assign a value to a data object. Due to this counter, \n",
